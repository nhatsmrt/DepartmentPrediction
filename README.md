# Predicting Departments from Email Correspondence
Based on the "email-Eu-core network" dataset.
## Work Done
Explore data with R, and extract some simple features (EDA.rmd).
<br>
Use node2vec to compute embedding(make_embedding.py), and implement a Graph Convolutional Network (Source/GraphConvNet.py) to predict the department of each node.
## Results
Accuracy: 77.6% (main_embedding.py)
